Goal
Deliver a working application where at least 90% of the code is generated by AI tools, and you act mainly as reviewer.

The idea is up to you (e.g. a small UI + API app), but it should include at least:

Several pages and components
Routing
A few different layouts (e.g. main layout, admin layout, etc.)
What you must deliver
Working project
A runnable solution (UI + optional API).
Code is mostly generated with Copilot with your review and minimal manual editing.
Prompt & workflow log (documentation)
A short document describing how you used AI to build the app:
All key prompts you used, in order (initial, refined, fixes, refactors, tests, etc.).
The context you provided (project description, constraints, existing code).
The models/tools you used (e.g. GitHub Copilot in VS / VS Code, ChatGPT, etc.).
Any used MCP servers or external tools (what for and how).
For each important step, show:
The prompt you used
The result (summary, not full code)
What you accepted/changed and why
Insights
Short section with your observations and learnings:
Which prompts worked well?
Which prompts did not work, and why?
What patterns in prompting gave the best results (e.g. “first ask for architecture, then ask for implementation per file”, etc.)?
Format
Project: in a repository (solution should build & run).
Documentation: README.md (or similar) in the repo with:
Overview of the app
Prompt history (key steps)
Tools/models/MCP used
Insights and recommendations for future use of Copilot.
 

Project Ideas for the Course
Skill Extraction Tool
An app that reads a new employee’s CV and IFU, extracts skills, and saves them in a structured format.
